## Expectations

We're pretty casual here, but there are a few things we're sticklers about:

1. Be on time to class.
2. Turn in all assignments on time.
3. Communicate. Slack all of your in-class instructors about any absences or if you think you might be late.
4. Ask for help. We're on the same team. You don't get a GPA. Cheating only hurts you.
5. Daily Feedback. The daily feedback form is mandatory. Becoming a programmer is not a one day event. It is a journey. This is your chance to reflect, tell us how things are going, and tell us if there's anything we could do to help.

## Success
Prime is an intense experience, and we want you to succeed. What we need from you is a willingness to 
1. Take Chances, Make Mistakes - You are not getting a GPA. More learning happens when you are not perfect. 
2. Ask for help from your instructors- We can't read your mind. You have to be proactive and advocate for your own understanding
3. Use Prime Staff for help - Everyone at Prime desires to help you - Scott, Myron, Rachael, we are all here to help!
4. Use your Peers - Your biggest asset is your cohort - make the connections and struggle together. You will be stronger together.
